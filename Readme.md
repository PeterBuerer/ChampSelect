#Installation
* Running ```git submodule update --init``` should be all you need to do

#Overview
This is a learning project for me. I am using it to gain experience interacting with an API (specifically the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started)), while also building an application based around one of my favorite games ([League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com))

The app itself is simply a champion library that provides information about a champ (abilities, stats, etc) when you tap on them.

###IMPORTANT 
This application requires an API key. To acquire one, simply log on to [http://developer.riotgames.com](http://developer.riotgames.com) with your League of Legends account and register a key.
